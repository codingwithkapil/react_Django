# react_Django
react with Django 


first change the DIR 

 ```linux
cd .\django_react_proj\
```

for run the project install the requiremnet

```python
pip install -t requirements.txt
```


then run the manage.py file 

```pytohn
python manage.py runserver localhost:5000
```


I use the localhost port 5000 because the react build run on localhost 5000 port.
